Common Reasons for Change Detection Issues

    Direct Object/Array Mutation: Angular does not detect changes when you directly modify properties of an object or elements of an array. It only detects changes if the reference to the object/array changes.

    Asynchronous Operations: Changes made inside asynchronous operations like setTimeout, setInterval, or after an HTTP call may not be detected if Angular is unaware of them.

    Change Detection Strategy: If you are using the OnPush change detection strategy, Angular will only check for changes when the input properties change by reference or an event occurs from the component or its children.

    Third-Party Libraries: Some third-party libraries may make changes outside Angularâ€™s zone, causing Angular to miss these changes.
